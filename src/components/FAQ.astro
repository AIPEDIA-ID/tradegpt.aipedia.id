  {
    question: "How is this different from other trading signals?",
    answer: "Most signal providers just give you entries without context. TradeGPT explains the reasoning behind each signal using technical analysis and macro factors. You learn while you trade, making you a better trader over time. And you can ask based on your conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "I'm busy with my day job. How much time does this require?",
    answer: "Designed for exactly that situation. 5 minutes in the morning to check your positions and any new signals. Weekend preparation takes 10–15 minutes. That's it. No need to watch charts all day."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm new to technical analysis?",
    answer: "Perfect for beginners. Every signal comes with clear explanations of why we're seeing that setup. You'll learn about RSI, MACD, support/resistance, and macro factors naturally through daily use."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to install anything to use this?",
    answer: "No installation needed. CustomGPT runs entirely via ChatGPT — you can access it directly through the ChatGPT app (both free & Pro tiers)."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I access the CustomGPT Assistant?",
    answer: "After purchase or signup, you'll get a direct link to open the GPT inside ChatGPT. Just click, start chatting — no setup, no browser extension needed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use it with a free ChatGPT account?",
    answer: "Yes! The free version of ChatGPT can access CustomGPT. But for best performance (especially with data analysis), GPT-4 is recommended."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I ask follow-up questions or customize my strategy?",
    answer: "Yes! That's what makes CustomGPT unique. You can ask it to explain signals in more detail, adjust analysis to your style (e.g. swing vs scalping), or even review your portfolio logic. It's not a one-way bot — it's a real assistant that talks back."
  },
  {
    question: "What crypto pairs do you cover?",
    answer: "Free tier covers BTC and ETH. Pro includes 20+ major pairs: SOL, ADA, DOT, LINK, MATIC, AVAX, and more. We focus on high-volume, liquid pairs where technical analysis is most effective."
  },
  {
    question: "Why one-time payment instead of subscription?",
    answer: "We believe in aligned incentives. Once you've paid, we want you to succeed long-term. No monthly pressure, no artificial scarcity tactics. Just honest analysis to help you trade better."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this financial advice?",
    answer: "No, this is educational analysis. TradeGPT provides technical and macro insights to help you make informed decisions. Always do your own research and never risk more than you can afford to lose."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a refund if it doesn't work for me?",
    answer: "No refunds, once you get access, it's yours for life. If you're unsure, try the free tier first to see how it works."
